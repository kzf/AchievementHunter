# Still To Do
Pull requests or ideas for new achievements are welcome. 

My preferred solution to the problem of certain achievements being unobtainable on specific devices is to allow games to be saved and loaded on different devices. (In fact, it would be nice if certain achievements required different devices, within reason). I haven't yet decided how I would like this to work so consider this feature a work in progress.
